# Neighborhood App

This knockout.js project renders a map using the Google Maps API and allows a
user to view and search entries from the front end. This app also
makes use of the Foursquare API with AJAX requests.

## Set Up

Open up the terminal and run `node index.js` to initiate the server.

The server will run on the local server on port 5000. Go to http://localhost:5000 on your browser to view the app.
